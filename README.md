# Employee-Payroll-Tracker-
A project updating existing code to display requested information when entered.


## This was my second code refactoring project for the UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I was given source code that was missing JavaScript neccesary to log employees into a payroll table by first name, last name, and salary. The project also required that I console log the average employee salary and a employee selected at random.

## Proceses and Challenges 

```
FIRST I created an array in JavaScript to hold employee information.
THEN I created a funtion with prompts to collect employee information.
THEN I created a function to calculate average salary.
THEN I created a console log to log average salary.
THEN I created a function to select a random employee.
THEN I created a console log to log a random employee as winner in console.
